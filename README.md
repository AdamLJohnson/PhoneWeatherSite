## Phone Weather ##
This is a experiment with creating a small application that will run on the idle browser for the Polycom VVX410 Phone. The idea is to show the weather and current time. 

I also plan on using this application to learn about 4 different JavaScript frameworks in a very simple way.

1. [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
2. [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/)
3. [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
4. [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

### Installing ###
1. Clone Repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run `grunt connect`
4. Open a browser to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)
